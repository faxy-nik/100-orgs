   SKY LIVING — additive enhancement layer for skies.js
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHAT THIS FILE IS
   skies.js owns two private <canvas> layers, its own SkyInstance /
   OverlayManager / AnimationManager, and the SKIES config array. All of
   that is closed over inside skies.js's IIFE and is NOT touched here —
   nothing in this file edits skies.js, its canvases, its rAF loop, or
   its data. This file adds a THIRD canvas on top (its own tiny rAF
   loop, paused with the same discipline skies.js uses: prefers-
   reduced-motion => static frame, tab hidden => stop) and hooks into
   the sky lifecycle the only way an outside script safely can: by
   wrapping the public window.Skies.apply() function.

   LOAD ORDER: this file must load AFTER skies.js.
     <script src="skies.js"></script>
     <script src="sky-living.js"></script>

   WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED
     1. Dynamic Moon System        (phase per sky, drift, glow halo, rise)
     2. Shooting Star System       (random spawn, click -> floating message)
     3. Interactive Star Field     (hover glow/scale, click ripple+sparkle)
     4. Constellation Generator    (heart / infinity / crescent / butterfly /
                                     rose / random-walk, click -> message)
     5. Floating Celestial Objects (per-sky weighted glyph drifters)
     6. Living Sky Evolution       (stars grow in, fog eases in, moon rises,
                                     slowly, for as long as a sky stays open)
     7. Rare Sky Events            (low-probability burst on sky change:
                                     meteor storm, aurora surge, comet,
                                     double rainbow, moon flare, lantern
                                     festival — visual only, self-clearing)
     8. Sky Journey Journal        (localStorage log of skies seen + a
                                     small toggleable panel to view it)
     9. Hidden Easter Eggs         (click counters -> unlock message)
    10. Ambient audio hook         (separate <audio> elements, own gain,
                                     never touches music.js's Jukebox/
                                     AudioContext — see SkyAmbience below.
                                     YOU must supply real file URLs; there
                                     are none built in.)
    11. Paragraph-reactive hook    (SkyLiving.setMood(mood) — call this
                                     from your own scroll/IntersectionObserver
                                     code in 100-organs.html / fantasies.html;
                                     this file can't discover your paragraph
                                     markup on its own, so it exposes the
                                     hook instead of guessing at it)

   WHAT'S DELIBERATELY NOT ATTEMPTED HERE (would need engine-level
   access this file doesn't have, or assets you haven't given me):
     - true cloud-occlusion of the moon (skies.js's CloudLayer is
       private canvas noise, not discrete sprites you can test moon-vs-
       cloud collision against) — approximated instead with a soft
       periodic dimming so the moon still visibly "breathes"
     - HDR exposure / bloom shader passes — this is 2D canvas, no WebGL
     - solar/lunar eclipse astronomy — "eclipse" rare event is a visual
       flourish, not a real ephemeris
